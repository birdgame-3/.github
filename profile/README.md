## 🔥 PROJECT OVERVIEW: THE MEME THAT BECAME MASSIVE REALITY

**Bird Game 3 (BG3)** is not just a game; it is a **cultural phenomenon** born from viral chaos. Starting as an entirely **AI-generated concept** on TikTok—where viral clips looked "real down to the pixel"—it is now being brought to life as a **massive multiplayer action title**.

We are responding to unprecedented public demand by building a world where players can finally choose their "bird main" and enter the fray. Expect **absolute chaos, unmatched fun, and total aerial dominance** in the avian kingdom.

> 📢 **"They exist. That is all you need to know."**
> *Official statement from Birdgame Studios regarding BG1 and BG2.*
